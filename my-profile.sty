Please describe an interest, favorite activity, or hobby of yours. It could be anything: just something you enjoy doing. For this particular answer, please only write up to 60 words and do it in a way that captivates your readers (us!).
I have a passion for programming, constantly exploring new languages and solving challenges. When I’m not coding, I’m either on the cricket field, feeling the thrill of every match, or sharpening my strategy in chess, where every move brings me closer to victory.

What is most important to you when you look for a new job? Please be completely honest and transparent about your situation and season of life; we’re not looking for “the right answer”. The more you tell us, the better we can align.

 When looking for a new job, growth and learning opportunities are most important to me. I want a role that challenges me technically while also allowing me to explore new skills. A supportive environment, where innovation and creativity are valued, is essential. Work-life balance and meaningful projects that align with my passions also play a key role.

Everyone learns differently. How do you learn best? And what’s something new that you’ve learned in the past few months? Big or small, we’re curious!

I learn best through hands-on experience—by diving into code, experimenting, and solving real-world problems. Recently, I’ve been mastering Vue.js, exploring its reactivity and component-based architecture. Building small projects and applying concepts immediately helps solidify my understanding. I love learning by doing, where each challenge leads to practical knowledge.

How did you hear about this open position?
I heard about this open position through a friend who shared the link with me. They knew it aligned with my interests and skills, so I was excited to check it out!

Show us some examples of concrete work you’re proud of having done yourself. Please tell us why you are proud of what you sent us. Please be as specific as possible.

I’ve worked on a NestJS microservice framework project, which involved designing scalable services that communicate seamlessly. I’m particularly proud of this project because it taught me how to build efficient, modular systems. I’m also working on a Laravel microservice and layered application. It's a dynamic, ongoing project that reflects my ability to handle complex architectures. Here's the link to the project: sab.servicestorefront.co.uk.

These projects represent my growth in backend architecture and my passion for building scalable, maintainable systems.

Can you give a concrete example of a recent situation where you “took ownership” of a task/project/etc at work and made something truly positive happen? How do you define “taking ownership” of your work?

Recently, I took ownership of a project where we needed to migrate from Laravel Vapor to AWS and implement a full CI/CD pipeline. I learned the necessary DevOps skills to manage the AWS environment, including automating deployments and infrastructure provisioning with tools like Jenkins and Docker.

Taking ownership, to me, means fully embracing responsibility—from understanding the problem to delivering the solution. I ensured smooth integration, resolved issues proactively, and facilitated the transition with minimal downtime, which brought significant improvements to the team's workflow.

What are the key skills you (would) bring to an asynchronous and remote work environment? What key skills do you feel you need to improve for you to fully thrive in such an environment? 

In a remote and asynchronous work environment, I bring strong self-discipline, excellent time management, and the ability to communicate clearly across different channels. My experience with tools like Jira, Slack, and Git ensures smooth collaboration.

However, I’m always looking to improve my adaptability to different time zones and enhance my async documentation skills for better knowledge-sharing across teams. Balancing communication and focus in a fully remote setting is an area I’m working on.

Which season of life are you currently in and what are your career goals? For example, are you in a season of life where you work long hours to learn as much as possible? Or in a season where you prioritize work-life balance because you’ve already gained substantial experience? The more transparency you give us, the better we can align and create common goals for your career. 

I’m in a season of life where learning and growth are my top priorities. I’m driven to expand my skill set, especially in areas like DevOps, backend development, and scalable architecture. While I’m open to working long hours to learn as much as possible, I’m also beginning to value work-life balance to maintain sustainable progress. My career goal is to become a well-rounded developer, excelling in both technical expertise and leadership roles, while continuing to explore new technologies.

What is your approach to monitoring the performance of live web applications? What techniques do you use to maintain good performance levels?

My approach to monitoring live web applications involves using tools like New Relic and Kibana, smartlook to track performance metrics such as response times, server load, error rates, and memory usage. I also set up alerts for critical thresholds to catch issues early.

To maintain good performance, I:

Optimize database queries by indexing and caching.
Implement load balancing and auto-scaling to manage traffic spikes.
Use caching layers like Redis for frequently accessed data.
Regularly run performance tests and profile the application to identify bottlenecks.
This proactive approach helps ensure stability and efficiency in production environments.

Could you please send us a sample of some production code you have written and are particularly proud of or find intriguing? Please also explain why you are proud of this code or why you find it interesting. I understand that you are likely under an NDA for some of your code, so it doesn't need to be executable. 



Here’s a simplified version of a Laravel middleware I wrote for protecting against SQL injection, LDAP injection, and XSS attacks. I’m proud of this code because it combines security best practices with clarity and performance. It monitors and sanitizes user input across the app, ensuring protection while maintaining speed.

php
namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class SqlQueryProtection
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        // Protecting against SQL injection
        foreach ($request->all() as $key => $value) {
            if (preg_match('/(UNION|SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|DROP|CREATE)/i', $value)) {
                return response()->json(['error' => 'SQL Injection detected'], 400);
            }
        }

        // LDAP injection protection
        if ($this->detectLdapInjection($request)) {
            return response()->json(['error' => 'LDAP Injection detected'], 400);
        }

        // XSS protection
        $request->merge(array_map('htmlspecialchars', $request->all()));

        return $next($request);
    }

    private function detectLdapInjection(Request $request)
    {
        $ldapPattern = '/[\*\(\)\'\"\\0\\\\]/'; // LDAP special chars
        foreach ($request->all() as $key => $value) {
            if (preg_match($ldapPattern, $value)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
Why I’m Proud:
It enhances security while being lightweight.
It addresses multiple vulnerabilities in one place.
Writing this helped me improve my understanding of security principles and middleware in Laravel. It was challenging but satisfying to create a robust solution for a critical aspect of the project.
